I'm not big on year in review posts, but some good things happened this year that are worth writing down, lest I forget them.

What kinds of things? In 2015, I:

- Open sourced [Radium](http://stack.formidable.com/radium/), a toolset for managing inline styles in React.
- Curated [CascadiaCSS](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/css/). This was the first year for CascadiaCSS, and my second time helping out with CascadiaJS (I did  [web stuff](http://2012.cascadiajs.com/) for the first year of the conference).
- Spoke at [CSS Dev Conf 2015](http://2015.cssdevconf.com/) about inline styles and scalable CSS. [My slides](https://speakerdeck.com/alexlande/react-inline-styles-and-the-future-of-css) are available on Speaker Deck, and I wrote a blog post about [the experience](http://www.alexlande.com/articles/how-i-made-my-first-conference-talk/). I'm planning to record a screencast version of this talk soon as well!
- Redesigned this blog [(as one does)](http://localhost:4000/articles/progress/).
- Published 10 blog posts (if you count this one, anyway).
- Started working reading and writing back into my [routine](http://localhost:4000/articles/how-i-learned-to-love-my-commute/).

Not bad. My goal for 2016 is to write a similar list that is twice as long. We'll see!
