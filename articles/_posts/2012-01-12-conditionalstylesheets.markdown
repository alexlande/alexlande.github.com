Intro - Why Nicolas Gallagher's Modular SASS Concept Rules, plus useful extensions.

### A Brief Review

The problem, Respond.js, stuffandnonsense.com

### Pre-processing to the Rescue

Quick overview of Modular SASS idea

### Taking it Further

Using with conditional html classes and ie.scss

### HTML5Shiv Optimizations

Talk about the Respond.js plus html5shiv thing. No longer so easy to give legacy browsers without JS legacy css. Or is it? Conditionally loading legacy.css with yepnope.

### Legacy â‰  IE

Despite the increasingly high version numbers we're at now, Firefox 4 was released less than a year ago. This approach does not support Firefox 3.6, which is a capable browser that likely deserves more than your base styles. Score one for Respond.js.
