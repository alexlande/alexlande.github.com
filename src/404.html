			<p>Sorry friendo, the page you tried to get to doesn't exist.</p>
			
			<p>You might want to try looking at my <a href="/projects">projects</a>, <a href="/articles">articles</a>, or even my <a href="/">home page</a>.</p>
			
			<p>If that doesn't work, panic. Feel free to <a href="mailto:alexlande@gmail.com?subject=Something is broken!">email me</a> about the problem.</p>
