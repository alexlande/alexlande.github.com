I decided to redesign my website right around New Year's Day (as one does). A
change was overdue-- since building the last version, I moved halfway across the
United States, stopped freelancing, and started working at [Formidable
Labs](http://formidablelabs.com). I spent a couple of days working on a new
version, got it to a place that started looking pretty good, then got caught up
in other things and never finished (as one does).

I left a screenshot of the design on my desktop as a reminder to pick it up when
I had time. A year passed.

In 2015, I decided to redesign my website, and started sketching out new ideas.
After a day, I noticed the old screenshot, which had become a permanent desktop
fixture. It looked OK to me. Good enough, anyway. I rewrote all of it and
tweaked the design a bit, but you're pretty much looking at the site that
I took a screenshot of a year ago. Ship it, right?
