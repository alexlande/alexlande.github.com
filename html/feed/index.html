   <title>Conditional Stylesheets Revisited</title>
   <link href="http://www.alexlande.com/articles/conditional-stylesheets/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re writing CSS in 2012, there&amp;#8217;s a good chance that you&amp;#8217;ve tried pre-processing through SASS or LESS. &lt;a href='http://nicolasgallagher.com/'&gt;Nicolas Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; recently described a SASS technique for mobile first development that allows you to easily deliver large screen styles to outdated browsers. After experimenting with the technique, I&amp;#8217;ve found some ways to push it even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='preprocessing_to_the_rescue'&gt;Pre-processing to the Rescue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://nicolasgallagher.com/mobile-first-css-sass-and-ie/'&gt;Nicolas&amp;#8217; technique&lt;/a&gt; uses SASS imports to create a media query-laden style sheet for capable browsers and an IE-specific style sheet that delivers the same styles in a conditional comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels sort of odd to use an IE style sheet in a world of &lt;a href='http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/'&gt;conditional classes&lt;/a&gt;, but if we&amp;#8217;re going to we might as well make the most of it. Even if you aren&amp;#8217;t much of a pre-processor, you&amp;#8217;ve likely realized that modularizing your CSS in this way doesn&amp;#8217;t have to stop with media queries. Since we&amp;#8217;re already creating an IE-specific style sheet, we might as well import our IE-specific styles (written with the aforementioned conditional classes) into that file and leave them out of the other, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@import &amp;quot;480.scss&amp;quot;;
@import &amp;quot;768.scss&amp;quot;;
@import &amp;quot;992.scss&amp;quot;;
@import &amp;quot;ie.scss&amp;quot;;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy as that, your main styles are free of &lt;code&gt;.ie7&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.oldie&lt;/code&gt;. Feels good, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='html5shiv_optimizations'&gt;html5shiv Optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the little-discussed benefits of media query polyfills like &lt;a href='https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond'&gt;Respond.js&lt;/a&gt; is that they make excellent companions to html5shiv. If you&amp;#8217;re using both, and a user visits your site on a legacy browser without JavaScript, they&amp;#8217;ll only receive your base styles. If you&amp;#8217;ve planned for this, that means they&amp;#8217;ll see a functional but basic page, one that isn&amp;#8217;t crippled by the lack of styled HTML5 elements and media queried layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing is possible with the SASS importing method. It&amp;#8217;s easiest if you&amp;#8217;re using &lt;a href='https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr'&gt;Modernizr&lt;/a&gt;, which has both html5shiv and a conditional loader called yepnope built in. Using yepnope, we can ensure that the legacy style sheet only loads when html5shiv is in use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--[if (lt IE 9) &amp;amp; (!IEMobile)]&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;yepnope(&amp;#39;legacy.css&amp;#39;);&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;![endif]--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can toss a script like &lt;a href='https://github.com/keithclark/selectivizr'&gt;Selectivizr&lt;/a&gt; in at the same time, if you&amp;#8217;re so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='be_not_afraid'&gt;Be Not Afraid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#8217;ve been talking about SASS here, this style of modular CSS isn&amp;#8217;t dependent on it. It &lt;a href='https://gist.github.com/1407227'&gt;works with LESS&lt;/a&gt;, with a build script a la HTML5 Boilerplate, and if you&amp;#8217;re really masochistic you could do it by hand with copy and paste. (Don&amp;#8217;t do that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your design is fully responsive and is built on a fluid grid, IE users will still enjoy an experience that meets them halfway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only concern is that the technique is IE specific. In the last week, multiple people have visited this site using Firefox 3. That&amp;#8217;s pretty strange, but it&amp;#8217;s worth noting that there are still people using legacy browsers other than IE. As always, take a look at your statistics before you do anything rash.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a rough draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my third rough draft, specifically. The others I threw away because they didn’t work. They tried for too little, or too much. After finishing the design for this one, I fought off the urge to throw it out as well and decided that the best course of action was to publish my rough draft, and go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is a fantastic medium because it gives us these sorts of opportunities. This will remain a draft for quite some time, but it will be updated often, subject to tweaks and changes on every front. I’m lucky to have realized along the way that this can never be perfect, but it can be good, and even great. It can also be a place of experimentation and missteps, and you can expect plenty of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along those lines, I plan to publish an article every month or two. They’ll vary in length and subject, but most will relate to design and the web in some way. A few may even be more technical: discussions of process or tricks. Either way, each will have a unique and fitting art direction, in the tradition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jasonsantamaria.com/&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://trentwalton.com/&quot;&gt;talented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://iampaddy.com/pop/&quot;&gt;folk&lt;/a&gt;. I’m doing so for two reasons: first, because I think that it would be interesting, and second, because I am selfish. A unique design for every article is a great venue for attempting new things. It also gives me a good excuse for only publishing every once in a while, instead of being embarrassed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in technical mumbo-jumbo, the inner machinations of this site are all stored in a repository on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/lawnday/alexlande.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. It’s powered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, with fonts served by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.typekit.com&quot;&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt;, and is built on Andy Clarke’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/320andup/&quot;&gt;320 and Up&lt;/a&gt; boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for visiting. More soon.&lt;/p&gt;
