				<p>Hi. I'm a front-end web developer based in Washington, Seattle.</p>
				
				<p>I went to school at the University of Colorado, where I studied anthropology. I have an unfortunately large collection of (mostly) punk rock records, have studied mantled howling monkeys in Costa Rica, and have a vague plan to climb every mountain in Colorado over 14,000 feet.</p>

				<p>Nowadays, I create striking, accessible, and <a href="http://futurefriend.ly/">future friendly</a> websites, ranging from online shops to professional learning systems. If you'd like, you can get in touch by <a href="mailto:alexlande@gmail.com?subject=Hello">email</a> or find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alexlande">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/alexlande">GitHub</a>, or <a href="http://zerp.ly/alexlande">Zerply</a>.</p>
				
				<p>For more about this site, you might want to read <a href="http://alexlande.com/articles/daybreak/">this brief article</a> I wrote about it.</p>
